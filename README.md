## Context
With an abundance of credit card options customers are always looking for better deals. As is the goal with any company, we are looking to prevent attrition in customers by targeting those at risk of canceling before they do so. 

## Dataset
This dataset was retrieved from Kaggle and contains over 10k observations which includes various details including age, gender, and education level to name a few.  There is also critical data on card usage, which can be used to determine which trends can predict customer attrition in the hopes of targeting those customers before they cancel their services.
